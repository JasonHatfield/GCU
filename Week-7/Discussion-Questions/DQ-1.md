JUnit and TestNG are both open-source unit testing frameworks for Java. "JUnit is the most popular unit testing framework" and is used as a basis for testing in many other frameworks and libraries (Hamilton, 2022). JUnit is simple to both set up and use and is well-documented. TestNG, on the other hand, is a more feature-rich framework that offers additional features such as data-driven testing, parallel testing, and annotation support.

JUnit requires that the tests be written in Java, and the tests must be annotated with @Test. TestNG, however, allows multiple languages, such as Java, Groovy, and Scala. Additionally, test methods can be parameterized, making it easier to test different values.

JUnit supports assertions, allowing for more detailed and precise testing. TestNG offers more powerful assertions, such as expected exceptions, groups, and dependencies.

Overall, both JUnit and TestNG are effective unit testing frameworks, but TestNG offers more powerful and flexible features that make it more suitable for complex and large-scale projects.
