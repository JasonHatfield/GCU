### Week 7: Christian World View
Christianity and technology are two concepts that often appear to be at odds with each other. Technology is often seen as something modern and progressive, whereas Christianity is seen as traditional and conservative. However, upon closer examination, it can be seen that Christianity has embraced technology in many ways.  "Technology has given Christianity a voice to reach a world-wide audience" (Sims, n.d., p. 5).

For instance, Christianity has been using technology to spread its message to a wider audience. Churches are increasingly using social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, to reach new followers. Additionally, some churches are even making use of video streaming services to broadcast their services online. This makes it possible for anyone to attend a service from anywhere in the world.  

Additionally, Christianity has adapted to the use of technology in its own religious practices. For example, many churches have adopted electronic giving, allowing members of their congregation to donate money to the church using credit cards or other payment methods. In addition, some churches have also begun to use virtual reality technology to create immersive religious experiences.  

Overall, it is clear that Christianity and technology can coexist in harmony. Technology can be used to make Christianity more accessible and to bring its message to a wider audience. Additionally, Christianity can use technology to enhance its religious practices, creating more immersive and meaningful experiences. As technology continues to evolve, it is likely that Christianity will continue to adapt and embrace the use of technology in its religious practices.
