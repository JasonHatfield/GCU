Provide a brief (3 to 4-sentences) description of how and why the output was displayed.

The boolean method in the Person class contains multiple if statements, that if false, will change this.firstName to person.firstName.

If the boolean value is this, null, or does not equal other.getClass() the output will be the println.

For this scenario, all three if statements were not true, so a new person object was created, and the name was returned.
