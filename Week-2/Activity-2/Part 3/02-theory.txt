Although person1 and person2 have the same name, these are not identical because the objects are located at different addresses.

Each person is created as a new object which is stored in the Person class, so when they are related in the if statement, the return is not true.

In order to access the same person, we would need to invoke an if statement that compared person1 to person1.
