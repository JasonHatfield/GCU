Provide a brief (3- to 4-sentence) description of what the @Override annotation 
is used for and why it is good practice to add this to overridden methods.

There are two reasons for the @Override annotation, but most importantly this
annotation is a best practice for programmers.

The first reason for using this annotation is to ensure the method following the
statement is actually overriding the super class. If the method is not completing
this action, a compile time erroor will be presented to the programmer.

Secondly, the annotation imroves readability in the code which gives either the
original or programmers, a better idea of the original intentions for the code.
