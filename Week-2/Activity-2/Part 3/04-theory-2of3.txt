Provide a brief (3- to 4-sentence) description of how both the 
equals() and toString() methods, if overridden, could be used in 
your Milestone project.

As my milestone project grows and becomes more complex, I can see the value in 
using the quals() and toString() methods.

The toString() method will override the default output and input another line of code.

Similarly, the equals() boolean method will give my milestone project the ability to 
use if statements once my end user selects various different products.

Ultimately, I think I will implement these methods into my program to help with adding
products to the user's cart.
