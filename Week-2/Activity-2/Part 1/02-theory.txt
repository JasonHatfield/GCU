When the program is started, the Game driver class creates a Superman and Batman object. 

Each object randomly generates a health integer from 1 - 1000, which is passed into the attack method of the SuperHero parent class. 

This class has two children classes, Batman and Superman. 

Each of those classes takes the health from the parent class and passes that health individually back to output onto the game console.
