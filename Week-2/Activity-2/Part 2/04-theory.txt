Each child class, Gun and Bomb, have a public method that matches the method in the parent class Weapon.

When a child class has the same method signature as the parent class, the contents of this method override that of the parent class.

In this instance, both of the children classes have overridden the Weapon parent class by invoking a different output to the console.
