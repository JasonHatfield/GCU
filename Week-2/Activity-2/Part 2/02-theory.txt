The game driver creates two objects, a bomb and a gun with a fire power of 10 and 5 respectively.

Although there are no methods in the Gun and Bomb children classes, the output is from the Weapon parent class.

This occurs because the children class inherit the println function from the Weapon parent class.

The extends keyword in the class signature creates this inheritance bond.
