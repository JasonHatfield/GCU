In the e-commerce database of Milestone 1, a single table that a database designer could use is called "PRODUCTS." This table would have a primary key called "PRODUCT_ID" and several rows and data columns. The columns of this table include the product name, product price, product description, product category, and product image. In addition, the rows of this table would include data for each product sold on the website.

The "PRODUCTS" table is an integral part of the e-commerce database, as it contains crucial information about the products sold on the website. For example, customers would use this table to search for products by name, price, or category and by web developers and managers to organize and analyze data about the products sold.

For example, I have chosen the e-commerce website Steam; the "PRODUCTS" table would contain data about each video game sold. This table could include the name of the video game (e.g., "Apex Legens" or "Assassin's Creed"), the price of the game, a description of the features of the game, the category of the game (e.g. "action" or "adventure"), and an image of the game art.

The "PRODUCTS" table would link to other tables in the e-commerce database, such as the "USERS" table, which would contain information about the customers who are using the website, and the "ORDERS" table, which would contain information about the placed orders on the website. This element would allow for efficient data management and querying, enabling users to retrieve related data from multiple tables quickly.

Overall, the "PRODUCTS" table is an essential part of the e-commerce database, as it contains crucial information about the products sold on the website. Furthermore, by organizing and storing this data in a structured and standardized way, the e-commerce website can provide customers with a convenient and user-friendly shopping experience and web developers and managers with valuable insights into the products sold on the website. Therefore, this database structure will help to ensure the success and growth of the e-commerce company and support its ability to provide high-quality products and services to its customers.
