# Week 6: Christian World View
We "are among the most technologically advanced human beings in the history of the world" (Desiring God, 2022, 0:04). This miracle of technology, including modern medicine, our smartphones, self-driving cars, and the airplane, are only a few examples of what we tend to take for granted. People forget how extraordinary our lives are because of technology and rarely give these innovations a second thought. Looking back through history, I realize there is no other time I would rather be alive than today.

Many Christians wonder what God thinks about technology, and I have had those same questions. Nevertheless, as technology becomes more pronounced in our lives, we can see that God is not becoming smaller but only bigger. We can look to the Cross to see just how big Christ is in light of the technological wonders surrounding us. 

"The angels in heaven are not bowing down to the wonders of silicon valley, the angels in heaven are bowing down to the glories and agonies of Jesus Christ" (Desiring God, 2022, 4:14). So, no matter how technologically advanced our world becomes, I can continue to look to Christ. When I do, I will remember that He will always outshine the highest levels of technology we can achieve.
