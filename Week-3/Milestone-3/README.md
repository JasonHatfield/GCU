## Milestone 3: Inventory Manager and Shopping Cart

- Analyze and model out, using UML class diagrams, an Inventory Manager that supports the following features:
  - Initialization of the Store inventory (should be invoked when the Store Front starts up).
  - Removing a Salable Product from Store inventory (should be invoked when a Salable Product is purchased).
  - Adding a Salable Product to Store inventory (should be invoked when a Salable Product purchase is canceled).
  - Return the entire inventory.
  - Integration of this class with the Store Front application.

- Analyze and model out, using UML class diagrams, a Shopping Cart that supports the following features:
  - Initialization of the Shopping Cart (should be invoked when the Store Front starts up).
  - Adding a Salable Product to the Shopping Cart (should be invoked when a Salable Product is purchased).
  - Removing a Salable Product from the Shopping Cart (should be invoked when a Salable Product purchase is canceled).
  - Return the contents of the Shopping Cart.
  - Empty the contents of the Shopping Cart.
  - Integration of this class with the Store Front application.

- Update the Salable Product UML class diagrams to support the following new features:
  - Update all Weapon classes so that they implement the comparable interface. Comparison should be based on the name of the item and follow alphabetical ordering rules that ignore case.

- Update the Store Front UML class diagrams to support the following new features:
  - Integration of the Inventory Manager.
  - Integration of the Shopping Cart.

- Update the flow chart of the logic of a Game User interacting with the Store Front and with the internal Inventory Manager and Shopping Cart.

- Implement the code for all UML class designs.

- Document all code using JavaDoc documentation standards and generate the JavaDoc files.
- Create a screencast video that includes a functional demonstration of the application and a code walk-through explaining how the design and code work. The screencast video should be 8â€“10 minutes long.
- Submit all code to an approved GCU GIT private repository.
