### Response
Technology has been part of the human experience since God provided Adam and Eve with clothes He created from the skins of animals. Since that moment, technology has advanced rapidly, and there is no better example of technological advancement than in the past 20 years. With the advancements made in socially connecting everyone across the world, the question arises whether or not technology is inherently evil.

> "The bible does not explicitly address how to use or when to avoid certain pieces of technology. However, it does address the moral behavior of Christians in everyday life" (Hayner & Thacker, 2020). 

For the most part, we cannot claim that technology of being morally wrong or evil. However, we must accept that people can and will use any technology for good or evil. As Christians, we must use technology as a tool for good and avoid the pitfall presented to us regarding the darker side of what is possible.
