### Response
This week, I focused on learning more about using the Interface class. The concept of interfaces has eluded me for some reason, and although I understand this on a surface level, I need help comprehending the general purpose. For example, according to w3schools, "interfaces cannot be used to create objects," they "do not have a body," and they "cannot contain a constructor" (n.d.). However, I understand the benefits of implementing this class more as I continue to practice my coding.

One of the benefits of using an interface is a higher level of security in the program because specific details are hidden about an object. Additionally, because Java does not support multiple instances of inheritance, a programmer can implement multiple interfaces to accomplish this task. When a class implements an interface, all methods must be overridden for the program to compile. An example of using multiple interfaces can be seen by clicking here.
