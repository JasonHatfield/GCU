## Topic 3: Interfaces And Polymorphism

Students learn how to analyze programming problems to apply object oriented interface and polymorphism principles. Also covered is object comparison. Students continue learning how to design solutions to problems using UML class diagrams and how to properly document their code.
Objectives:

1. Design classes using UML class diagrams applying object oriented interface techniques.
2. Design classes using UML class diagrams applying object oriented polymorphism techniques.
3. Develop classes applying object oriented interface techniques.
4. Develop classes applying object oriented polymorphism techniques.
5. Compare objects using the comparable interface.
